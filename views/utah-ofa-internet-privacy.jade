        p Your Utah members of congress voted to repeal federal rules prohibiting companies from keeping your internet activity private.  
        p Your representative erased these privacy protections so that companies like CenturyLink, Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon can sell your internet activity to marketers and make still more money off of you. These very same companies used to pursue aggressive marketing techniques before the privacy rules were made, like storing your searches, selling your browsing data, and inserting unwanted advertisements into your browsing. This isn’t speculation, it’s what these companies have done before and what they will do now, without your knowledge.
        p You pay your Internet bill to access the internet, not to get more ads and marketing. With literally zero public support for eliminating Internet privacy rules, your Utah representative acted solely to benefit the nation's biggest phone, cable and Internet companies instead of you.
        
        h4 Call your Utah member of Congress and tell them you think they made a mistake, and that they should stop giving away your right to privacy to marketers!
        p We have made it really simple; it won't take more than 5 minutes of your time.

            p Hi, my name is #[span(id='yourName')] and I am a Utah resident, calling from #[span(id='yourCity')]. My zip code is #[span(id='yourZip')]. 
            p I heard that my representatives in Congress voted to take away rules protecting the privacy of what I do online, and I think this was a big mistake! I don't understand why my representatives are voting so Internet providers can make more money off of me instead of protecting my privacy.
            p I very much want a response and some kind of explination. Thank you very much for listening!
