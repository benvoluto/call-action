        p Our state, California, is a global leader in the kinds of technologies and industries needed to make a substantial difference in overall carbon emissions. But no one in Congress—or the entire US government—is a leader on climate change now, because they do not perceive this global emergency as an issue that people vote on. We can change that. Our own US Senator, Kamala Harris, is sympathetic to the importance of this issue, and has a role to give advice and consent to the ruinous actions of the President’s administration, but could do much more. 
        p Senator Harris is a member of the subcommittee overseeing EPA and should publicly call for hearings on climate change science. 
        p Senator Harris should make a big issue of the near-elimination of our ability to study climate change in the current US budget proposal coming up for a vote. 
        p Senator Harris should publicly call for the US to rejoin the Paris climate accords, so that the US can coordinate with other countries.
        p Senator Harris should step up to lead our nation’s response to this world-historical crisis. Our state and nation need her to lead.
        
        h4 Call Senator Harris and tell her.
        p We have made it really simple; it won't take more than 5 minutes of your time.

            p Hi, my name is #[span(id='yourName')] and I am a California resident, calling from #[span(id='yourCity')]. My zip code is #[span(id='yourZip')]. 
            p I am extremely concerned about the lack of leadership that Senator Harris has shown on climate change. I understand that there are many important causes she can choose from to focus on, and I am pleading with her to make this issue her priority. 
            p Senator Harris can fill the void left by our President, and like the state of California she can become a global leader to protect our climate. I would like her to at least make a public statement, and introduce resolutions in the Senate. I will watch her actions and hold her accountable if she does not take serious action. I would like a response to my call. Thank you!
