        p Trump and Scott Pruitt, friends to the fossil fuel industry, want to kill the EPA's Clean Power Plant initiative, which aimed to curb greenhouse gas emissions from #[a(href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/two-ohio-coal-burning-power-plants-bite-the-dust/") increasingly obsolete] coal-fired power plants. This plan was based on a ruling from the EPA declaring carbon dioxide a harmful pollutant that requires regulation, and could have been the single largest tool in cutting greenhouse gas emissions to help avoid dangerous climate change. The EPA estimated that the Clean Power Plan could reduce CO#[sub 2] pollution from the energy sector by 32% below 2005 levels by 2030. 

        p The Clean Power Plan will require emissions cuts that are only slightly deeper than what states are already on track to achieve, and would impose emissions limits upon states with coal-fired power plants. The plan even leaves it to the states to decide how to lower these emissions. It is #[a(href='https://www.edf.org/sites/default/files/content/list_of_supporters_of_the_clean_power_plan_in_court.pdf') supported by 18 states], plus the District of Columbia, and many environmental groups support the regulation of CO#[sub 2] under the Clean Air Act. 

        p Pruitt and Trump imagine that removing pollution standards will bring back lost coal and manufacturing jobs, but the demand for coal has been waning, given the abundance of natural gas in recent years. The only people this will help will be coal power plant operators, not workers or miners. They care more about protecting old coal plants and their friends in the industry than about our air or our planet. 

        p Lisa Murkowski (R, Alaska) is the chair of the subcommittee with budget oversight (Subcommittee on the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Committee on Appropriations), and Tom Udall (D, New Mexico) is the ranking member. Kamala Harris (D, California) is on the Environment and Public Works Committee which has general oversight over the EPA.

            p Hi, my name is #[span(id='yourName')] and I am calling from #[span(id='yourCity')]. My zip code is #[span(id='yourZip')]. 
            p I am calling to oppose Trump's Executive Order abandoning the EPA Clean Power Plan. I am disgusted that Trump’s EPA cares more about the coal power industry than keeping our air clean, stopping global climate change, and moving our country past its reliance on fossil fuels. EPA should be protecting our environment instead of coal power plants! 

            p I want the senator to publicly call for the Trump administration and Scott Pruitt to stop this Executive Order and return to the Clean Power Plan, a sane and smart way to help our environment. 
            
            p Please record my opinion. Thank you very much for listening!
